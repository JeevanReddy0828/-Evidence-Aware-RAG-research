    "text": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The three main types of machine learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, making predictions based on input-output pairs. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, with clustering and dimensionality reduction being key techniques. Reinforcement learning trains agents through rewards and penalties in an environment."

    "text": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Key NLP tasks include text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering. Modern NLP heavily relies on transformer architectures, introduced in the 'Attention is All You Need' paper in 2017. Large language models like GPT, BERT, and LLaMA have revolutionized NLP by achieving state-of-the-art results across many tasks. These models are pre-trained on large text corpora and can be fine-tuned for specific applications."

    "title": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
    "text": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches for question answering and text generation. RAG systems first retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base, then use a language model to generate answers based on the retrieved context. This approach helps reduce hallucinations by grounding the model's outputs in factual information. Key components of RAG include the retriever (often using dense embeddings), the knowledge base, and the generator (typically a large language model). RAG is particularly useful for knowledge-intensive tasks where the model needs access to up-to-date or domain-specific information."

    "title": "Vector Databases and Semantic Search",
    "text": "Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are essential for modern AI applications including semantic search, recommendation systems, and RAG pipelines. Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant, and ChromaDB. These databases use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms like HNSW, IVF, and PQ to enable fast similarity search at scale. Vector databases typically support both dense vectors from neural embeddings and sparse vectors from TF-IDF or BM25. Integration with embedding models from OpenAI, Cohere, or open-source alternatives is common."

    "title": "The Apollo 11 Moon Landing",
    "text": "Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, collecting samples and conducting experiments. Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds of lunar material to bring back to Earth."
